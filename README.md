# collection

A collection with my tiny works.

## change-log:
Just upload a simple html page while learning... Nothing special...

or something other than html code

This repository is my drafts, experiments, etc. Some of them are complete in nature, but the size is too small to be considered an entire project.

Reminder: if `git push` fails, try `git push git@github.com:sclereid/collections.git`.
